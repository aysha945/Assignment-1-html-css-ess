    <p>Some early treatises—such as those of Cicero on the pleasantness of old age or on the 
    art of “divination,” Seneca on anger or clemency, and Plutarch on the passing of oracles—presage 
    to a certain degree the form and tone of the essay, but not until the late 16th century was the 
    and deliberately nonchalant and versatile form of the essay perfected by the French writer Michel de
    Montaigne.At the beginning of the 17th century, social manners, the cultivation of politeness, and the
    training of an accomplished gentleman became the theme of many essayists. This theme was first exploited 
    the Italian Baldassare Castiglione in his Il libro del cortegiano

    Writing an academic essay means fashioning a coherent set of ideas into an argument. Because essays are essentially linear—they offer one idea at a time—they must present their ideas in the order that makes most sense to a reader. 
    Successfully structuring an essay means attending to a reader's logic.A typical essay contains many different kinds of information, often located in specialized parts or sections. Even short essays perform several different operations: 
    the argument, analyzing data, raising counterarguments, concluding. Introductions and conclusions have fixed places, but other parts don't. Counterargument, for example, may appear within a paragraph, as a free-standing section, as part 
    of the beginning, or before the ending. Background material (historical context or biographical information, a summary of relevant theory or criticism, the definition of a key term) often appears at the beginning of the essay, between the 
    introduction and the first analytical section, but might also appear near the beginning of the specific section to which it's relevant.
